Goal
To take the skills learnt over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidate’s general development capabilities and visual and technical skills.

Course Relevant Outcomes:  
This project aligns with the Semester Project 2 learning outcomes by requiring candidates to demonstrate their ability to independently or collaboratively develop a functional digital solution. Candidates should be able to:

Assess their own work in relation to universal design guidelines.
Plan and develop interactive web solutions using industry-relevant tools and techniques.
Reflect on their development process, explaining design and technical decisions.
Implement ethical and accessible digital solutions tailored to the needs of a defined target group.
Document the development process and decisions made along the way.

Project Learning Outcomes:  
I can plan a web application project
I can design a UI for a web application
I can use HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript to build a web application interface
I can use vanilla JavaScript to interact with API data
I can use vanilla JavaScript to add UI functionality
I can write clean, modular code
I can test a web application using online tools
I can deploy a web application to a static host

Project Overview:  
Welcome to Semester Project 2, designed to challenge candidates to work independently or collaboratively on a real-world assignment. The goal is to develop a front-end application for our online auction API, allowing users to register, list items for bidding, and engage in auctions seamlessly. Candidates must demonstrate their ability to plan, develop and document a dynamic, interactive solution for a specific target group. The back-end API will be provided, and you or your team is responsible for implementing a high-quality front-end that integrates with it.

Time Commitment
Full Time – 5 weeks | Part-Time – 10 weeks

User Requirements:  
The application should allow users to register, log in and interact with listings. User authentication will be restricted to only those with an email address ending in @stud.noroff.no to ensure that only eligible participants can create an account. Once registered, users should be able to log in securely, manage their profiles and participate in the auction process.

Registered users can edit and update their profile bio and set a custom avatar and banner. In the profile page, the registered user should be able to see the listings they created and the listings they have made a bid on. Additionally, each user should be able to view their total credit, representing their available funds for bidding on items. This information must be easily accessible within their account dashboard. The registered user’s credits should always be visible on any page if the user is logged in.

One of the application’s core functionalities is the ability to create and manage (i.e., update and delete) listings. A registered user should be able to create a listing by providing a title, a deadline date for the auction, a media gallery showcasing images of the item, and a description. This ensures potential bidders have all the necessary details to make informed decisions.

Bidding is an essential feature of the auction house. A registered user should be able to bid on another user’s listing. The system should display a history of bids on each listing, allowing users to track the bidding process and adjust their bids accordingly. Transparency in the bidding process is crucial to fostering user engagement and trust.

While bidding requires registration, unregistered users should still be able to browse, search through available listings and view a single listing. This functionality ensures prospective users can explore the platform’s offerings before creating an account. The search feature should be intuitive, allowing users to filter listings based on keywords, categories or other relevant attributes.

Design & User Experience Expectations:  
The interface should be modern, clean and responsive across all devices. Navigation should be intuitive, ensuring users can seamlessly transition between browsing listings, placing bids and managing their profiles. Accessibility and ease of use are top priorities, as the platform will cater to a diverse audience.

Your design application should have a high-fidelity design for desktop and mobile screen sizes. The design must also be interactive, allowing a user to navigate through a happy flow in the application. The design must represent the final product with colours and web-optimised images.

Technical Requirements:
You/your team will be responsible for implementing the front-end using modern web development practices. Integration with our provided API should be smooth, with clear error handling and feedback mechanisms to ensure a robust user experience.

API Documentation:

You are required to use version 2 (v2) of the Noroff API, which can be found at the following link: https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2

The Auction House API can be found at the following link: https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2/auction-house/listings

Separate “Auth” end-points for authentication and authorisation can be found at the following link: https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2/auth/register

Video demonstration:

Technical Restrictions:

The following technical restrictions are in place.

NOTE: This assignment does not permit front-end frameworks like Vue, React, Nuxt.js or Next.js.

Hosting Services
GitHub Pages
Netlify
Vercel
Design Applications
Figma
Planning Applications
Trello

Working in groups:  
You may work in groups of up to 3 individuals per group. When working in a group, one student must create the repository and invite others to collaborate on the project.

Please note that the following applies when working in groups:

A student may only work in one group and not across multiple groups.
You must specify who you have worked with in your report, and each team member will still be required to write their own report.
You must use branches, create pull requests and follow a review process before merging the code.

Submission Access  
Please test each of your links to ensure they are accessible before submission. Should a link not be accessible by the grader, no marks will be allocated. You can test if links are accessible by opening them in an Incognito tab.

Deliverables:
A link to the Figma design. Alternatively, you can submit a PDF document titled “Student Name - Figma design,” which contains boards with all the views in your design.
A link to the Project Software you have used. Alternatively, you can submit a PDF document titled “Student Name - Project Management” which contains screenshots of the Sprints, Epics, and Issues, elaborating on why you chose to create these issues.
A PDF reflection report on this project’s management, explaining why some choices were made when developing this web application. This section can discuss some of the more difficult tasks and how the results were achieved. The reflection report section must be between 500 and 1000 words and can include additional screenshots of what is being addressed. When working in a group, each team member must have their own report.
